# Mortgage Calculator


## Description
A command line tool for determining monthly payments for a potential mortgage build using Java. This is a continuation of my delving into Java, learning a brand new language to me from the ground up. I'm using Eclipse as my IDE and familiarizing myself with that since it's new to me as well, everything up to this point I've built using VS Code. Eclipse has a tool they call eGit, which was clunky at first, but the more I'm using it the more I'm liking it. I can say it's much easier to create a remote first then push to a repository than it is to clone one on github first.
